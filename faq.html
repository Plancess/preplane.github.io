                  Can we recommend JEE Video Lectures to the students who are preparing for Board Exams?
                </div>
                <p class="faq-answer">
                  Of course we can offer JEE video lectures for Board preparation. JEE Video Lectures cover all the topics which are asked in JEE exam and all these topics are also covered in CBSE Board exams. These video lectures are designed in such a way that they start from the fundamentals and gradually move towards more advanced topics, so it makes sense to recommend this to students who are preparing from Board exams. Students will be more confident for their Board exams after consuming this content.

                <div class="faq-question">
                  How useful these lectures will be for students who belong to State Boards?
                </div>
                <p class="faq-answer">
                  Except very few topics, most of the topics will have intersection with JEE syllabus. Therefore, there is no doubt that it will useful for students belonging to State Boards. If you observe closely, you will notice that all the important topics which carry higher weightage in State Boards, have the similar weightage in JEE exams. So, in order to maximise their marks in State Boards, these video lectures are highly recommended.

                <div class="faq-question">
                  Can we recommend these Video Lectures to students preparing for other Engineering Entrance examinations?
                </div>
                <p class="faq-answer">
                  All most all the engineering entrance examinations either on National level or State level, cover the same topics as covered in JEE exams except some few topics. Almost 90% to 95% of the topics which carry higher weightage in total marks in other engineering entrance exams, are covered in JEE and so are in JEE Video Lectures.
                </p>

                <div class="faq-question">
                  Have we covered only the Theoretical part of the subjects?
                </div>
                <p class="faq-answer">
                  Not at all. All the lectures include comprehensive coverage of every ingredient required to enhance the understanding. After every concept we cover, there are illustrations given by faculties to enhance the understanding. Once a particular chapter is finished, the faculty again discusses critical and advanced level questions to take it to the level it is required for JEE.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <div class="faq-question">
                  Are these illustrations and questions discussed in the video lectures are enough for JEE Preparation?
                </div>
                <p class="faq-answer">
                  There is no end to practicing questions for the concept learned. More you practice, more you get better. So, the right way to say it, is that questions-illustrations discussed in JEE Video lectures are more than enough for a student to feel confident about his/her preparation. At the same time, practicing more questions is recommended apart from these Video Lectures.

                <div class="faq-question">
                  How authentic are these Video Lectures in terms of accuracy and relevancy?
                </div>
                <p class="faq-answer">
                  All these video lectures are delivered by IIT graduates and JEE Rankers who have long and rich experience in training students for JEE preparation. Hence there is no question about the accuracy and relevancy of the content delivered in the video lectures.

                <div class="faq-question">
                  How different are these Video lectures from the traditional videos?
                </div>
                <p class="faq-answer">
                  The very first difference is, in these videos, the faculty does show his back again and again. In the traditional format, when the faculty turns back, he or she hides the content written on the board, thereby hindering the concentration of the students. In our videos, there is a direct interaction with the students. The faculty writes in front of the student and never turns back. Another peculiar thing is, in most of the lectures, our faculty takes the help of 2D or 3D animation to bring out the deeper meaning of complex concepts. There is a direct interaction of concept with the faculty through animation.

                <div class="faq-question">
                  How frequently do we update these videos, in case there is change in the syllabus of JEE?
                </div>
                <p class="faq-answer">
                  The change is addressed immediately and accordingly the content is updated without any loss of time.
                </p>

                <div class="faq-question">
                  How do we address the Practice aspect of the students?
                </div>
                <p class="faq-answer">
                  We have taken this aspect very seriously and therefore designed a robust platform, PrepLane (www.preplane.com) which carries more than 50,000 questions for the students to practice. Every question is aligned with every concept covered in IIT JEE syllabus. Also to note here that every month we add 10,000 questions to this platform so that students never run out of questions and can practice endlessly.
