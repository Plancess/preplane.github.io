            Dear Friends,
            <p>
              Petroleum, Coal &amp; Banking Employees Welfare Society, a Society formed by officers of leading corporates of India with a mission to improve the life of the large employee family and others to whom we may be able to reach in various ways. Education along with skill development in children these days, is a major issue. We invite you to join hands with us as a part of our mission in improving the future of not only our children but also extend to whoever in reach. Petroleum, Coal &amp; Banking Executives Welfare Society viz PCB has made a mission to help improve the availability of excellent education since it’s well known that quality of education is a major area of concern for all parents
            </p><p>
            Since mythological times the search for best Guru has been prime motive of Parents/ Guardians, so that best education/ skills could be imparted in their wards. Even the Greatest Mythological Warrior Bhism Pitamah, heartily welcomed Extremely Skilled Teachers like Dronacharya to teach and impart skills to both his Great Grand Sons Kaurav's and Pandav's. <br /><br />
          <strong>Current Education and Tutorial System relies on Students' Memory Power.</strong></p><p>
          Sharp recall from memorised subjects is the key to success today and has been so from times immemorial :example</p><p>
          As mentioned in chapter Ashvamedhika Parva (Sanskrit: अश्वमेध पर्व), or the "Book of Horse Sacrifice," which is the fourteenth of eighteen books of the Indian Epic Mahabharata, after winning battle with Kaurav's and performing Ashvamedhika Yagna, which made Pandav's Supreme, PAN India, when Krishna was leaving, Hindu Mythological Greatest Hero, Arjuna told Krishna that he has forgotten Geeta Recitals and requested Krishna to recite the same again.
        <br /><br />
        This means, when Hindu Mythological Greatest Hero, Arjuna could not remember such important recital like Geeta, in one sitting ,how all young students can remember every formula along with its application, theorem or full chapter of full course of one or two years easily.
      </p><p>
      As different students may forget different topics of their syllabus, there is no provision in any school or in any tuition classes which can help them revise, in last moment whatever they have forgotten, thereby leaving them confused ,breaking confidence &amp; moral at the crucial moment.
    </p><p>
    <strong>Solution through Technology</strong>
  </p><p>With Upgradation of Technology how Education format changed and made impact on Society.</p><p>
  Initially when printing technology was not there, as mentioned in mythology and History etc., teaching was done in form of recitals by Guru to his disciples. As there were very limited talented Gurus the education was only for selected few, who were either Kings or Kinsmen only.
<br /><br />
With the discovery of printing technology, printed books came into existence. That was a revolution in the field of education because the host of information that was stored during the entire history of mankind did not remain the sole property of a small group, viz., experts, it was available for the common people. But as the Top Educational Institutions had limited good faculty, there gates are still open to very few top merit holders or those whose parents can pay huge capitation/ donation fees.
</p>
<p>
  Now with Internet, Video and 2D/3D technology being developed and available to one and all, the requirement of “chalk and talk” form of teaching may also fade out soon. This is seen as all Major Universities/ Academic Institutions, World over have very successfully started Distance education, through net, which has worked wonders for many aspiring students.
</p>
<p>
  As in last decade, distance education has worked successfully, tutorials through Video Lectures having 2D Animation should also help students, as the quality of tutorials remain the best, since students get tutored by Worlds top faculty consisting of IITians, PHD's from US, IIM's etc. 
</p>
<p>Today more then ever before ,all parents/guardians make every effort to get best faculty</p><p> to teach their Children. World over, the Institutes which have best faculties are rated at the top as they are  assurance of a bright future due to outstanding skill &amp; career development of their students. 
</p>
<p>
  <strong>The development is based on the following observations:</strong>
</p><ol>
<li>Every Child has the potential and desire to excel in life.</li>
<li>Every family desires and puts in best efforts for their progeny to outperform them.</li>
<li>In India, because of Shortage of Good Faculty, Good education is rare and thus highly competitive.</li>
<li>In Primary Sections, the average class result is from Good to Very Good and no failure as all students end up securing high grades/marks, whereas, in Secondary Sections, there is a drop in average class results and in Higher Sections, the total pass percentage drops drastically and average competitive exams success results are in single percentage only.</li>
</ol>
<p>
  <strong>Challenges to success &amp; consistent performance in Academics</strong>
</p>
<p>
  Problem of large course and acute competition. Most of Board/ Competitive exam questions consists of two years course, it is a difficult task for any child to remember full (two year) course from beginning to end. Moreover, there is a high possibility that the child may forget some chapters of different subjects.
</p>
<p>
  As the current Tutorials System Test Child Memory to remember full two years course of all three subjects. This system has failed to help in instead of solving every student last minute queries and providing them revisions as individually required
</p>
<p>
  Grasping power varies from child to child, during classroom teaching all children may not understand all the chapters of every subject equally well. Moreover, till adolescence, most of the children are extremely emotional and shy and do not open up to share their problems and therefore, they hesitate in letting their parents &amp; teachers know about the unclear topics. This is exactly where the problem arises/ starts and grades start falling down. The issue is further enlarged in competitive exams as this stage requires 100% accuracy/understanding &amp; most parents and conventional tutorials are also unable to teach&amp; groom the child, leading to a drastic drop in passing percentage and frustrations. As the problem of the child remains unsolved, they are unable to understand the topic further and thereby loses interest in that particular subject/ topic and starts shunning the subject and develop huge dislike for same.
</p>
<p>
  Different students have different nature. Few are shy and may not accept that they have not understood the school / tutorials lectures and do not even tell /ask this to their teachers. These video lectures will help them to replay the subject and chapter again and again till they understand the same, in privacy of homes. As we all know that practice makes one perfect, we also know that repeated narration of any subject brings clarity and understanding and then command of same subject. 
  This will also help in pre exam revision as the entire 2 year course is available in your home
</p>
<p>
  At primary sections, Syllabus is general, light &amp; easy for Parents and family to teach the child, thus enabling better understanding of subjects thereby contributing in child getting high grades, but as the child progresses from primary sections to higher sections and to Competitive Exams, most Parents and families find it difficult to teach the child, as they themselves lack thorough understanding of subjects, and also have time constraints.
</p>
<p>
  Lack of Good Faculty in Educational Institutions: It is a known fact that most Indian Educational Institutions lack good faculty and suffer from several limitations that leads to almost negligible individual / personal attention. This also makes admissions to well known colleges a major challenge.
</p>
<p>
  Available Solutions: This further led to growth of private tuitions, which are at very High Cost. The Top coaching classes, once they give good results at their first or main centre, expand PAN India through branches/ franchises, en-cashing the expertise of their expert faculty, which is only available at their main centre. 
</p>
<p>
  Though they keep the fees same and exorbitantly high in all their branches/ franchises PAN India, as they charge in their main centre, but they do not provide same expert faculty all across their PAN India franchises/ branches as what is available in their main centre. That is why parents prefer to send their children to Kota for two years coaching instead of getting their children admitted in local branches/ franchises. 
  Even after getting the child admitted in local/ main branches there is no guarantee that the child will understand every topic as after good results these coaching classes increases the class strengths so much that it’s very difficult for faculty to give attention to individual problems and the pace of teaching is very high, So if child fails to understand any topic during the class may not be able to catch up with the class leading to demoralisation of the child.

</p>
<p>
  The Parents and family members can also revise or learn each and every subject thereby increasing their participation and improving the Child learning and remembrance even in both higher sections and competitive exams.
</p>
<p>
  Our Solutions As the tutorials are offered through Video lectures in case of both offline and online by same faculty, there is no deterioration in courses, or method of delivery as the same person is available to you 24/7.

  These should help the student in the following way: </p><p>
  As the career making classes starts from class IX, X and thereafter XI &amp; XII, it is difficult to remember entire course at Board final/ competitive exams. Both in School and Tuitions Classes there is no provision to revise the complete course at the last leg of session and therefore, these videos lectures would help your ward to revise the same at the last leg of session, thereby improving their chances of performing much better in exams. </p><p>
  As the child's examination performance majorly depends on involvement of their parents/ guardians in his teaching. That is why in lower standards most children perform well as parents/ guardians are able to teach them personally. But as they reach middle / Higher standards, parents/ guardians are unable to teach them personally, as they themselves lack complete understanding of latest topics/ subjects. Using video lectures, same could be eliminated as both the online &amp; offline Video Lectures could be viewed in together with the student and or separately by parents or guardians, which will also help them to revise/ refresh their knowledge and in turn they will be able to help their child. </p><p>
  In the full duration of Course, it has been observed that at the end, the child may face difficulty in understanding and solving problems of few chapters in different subjects. During that time the tutorials on these subjects are not available due to which they fail to perform in exams, thereby affecting their career adversely.
</p>
